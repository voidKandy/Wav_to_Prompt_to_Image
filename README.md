# Wav_to_Prompt_to_Image
Use OpenAI api's to create images using .wav files.

## As my first ever coding project this is a bit of a mess
#### But it's got some neat ideas
Upload any `.wav` file to see it turned into a cool image!

The interface will prompt you for an `openai api key`, once you've inputted that, go crazy!

## How it works. 
The `.wav` file is turned into a vector, that vector is turned into 10 letters, those letters are then turned into words, and then a 'mad libs' like prompt is filled out and the image is created!
